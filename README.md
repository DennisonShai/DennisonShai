- 👋 Hi, I’m @DennisonShai and welcome to my GutHub. Here I will undo the tie LinkedIn has so tightly around my neck and let my curious cat out onto the street (don't worry, it will survive)
- 👀 I’m interested in data science. Bland, I know, but this straight-to-the-point discipline hides more than meets the eye. Are you waiting for me to tell you what it's hiding? Oh, I don't know either. Yet
- Join me on this journey as I answer that question and the many more that will pop up along the way!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analytics basics. Not very wow-factor, but I plan to start by using the basics of every data analytics tool to show you and myself how much you can achieve with elementary
  Knowledge of the tools in data science
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cross-disciplinary projects. Let's challenge the notion that data analysts are merely for summarising, reach out, and let's show how a microwave and an Excel sheet can give birth
- to the next Obama!
- 📫 How to reach me: on LinkedIn. I'm new to this app, so if I can't find an appropriate place to put the link, here's my email: shaiteleki@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: it? jokes, he/him
⚡ Fun fact: I GREW A BEANSTALK! I put a bean in the ground; it didn't die this year!
